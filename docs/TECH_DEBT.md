## Tech Debt Log (grouped details)

### A. Repository & Persistence
- **TD1** ‚Äì Replace in-memory store with a DB-backed repo (SQLite first).
- **TD13** ‚Äì Add `PlayRepository` interface and wire routers via dependency injection.
- **TD19** ‚Äì Standardize UUID usage across all routes to ensure uniform validation and parsing.
- **TD20** ‚Äì Design concurrency-safe access pattern (threading lock or async lock) for in-memory repo before DB migration.
- **TD21** ‚Äì Transactional delete pipeline: Once DB and storage layers exist, implement cascading deletes (plays ‚Üí diagrams, blobs, background jobs).  
  *Why:* Prevents orphaned resources and ensures consistency.  
  *When:* After DB + worker service rollout (Day 16).

### B. Validation & Error Shape
- **TD2 / TD7** ‚Äì Enforce UUID format for GET by id and add negative tests.
- **TD4 / TD12** ‚Äì Harden `video_path` validation.
- **TD5 / TD10 / TD11** ‚Äì Dev-override path rules.
- **TD9** ‚Äì Standardize 422 error envelope.

### C. Pagination & Filtering
- **TD15** ‚Äì Add `hasMore` boolean to list responses.
- **TD14** ‚Äì Switch to composite/opaque cursors post-DB migration.

### D. API Consistency & Mappers
- **TD16** ‚Äì ‚úÖ Resolved.
- **TD17** ‚Äì ‚úÖ Resolved.
