## Tech Debt Log (grouped details)

### A. Repository & Persistence

- **TD1** – Replace in-memory store with a DB-backed repo (SQLite first).
- **TD13** – Add `PlayRepository` interface and wire routers via dependency injection.
- **TD19** – Standardize UUID usage across all routes to ensure uniform validation and parsing.
- **TD20** – Design concurrency-safe access pattern (threading lock or async lock) for in-memory repo before DB migration.
- **TD21** – Transactional delete pipeline: Once DB and storage layers exist, implement cascading deletes (plays → diagrams, blobs, background jobs).  
  _Why:_ Prevents orphaned resources and ensures consistency.  
  _When:_ After DB + worker service rollout (Day 16).

### B. Validation & Error Shape

- **TD2 / TD7** – Enforce UUID format for GET by id and add negative tests.
- **TD4 / TD12** – Harden `video_path` validation.
- **TD5 / TD10 / TD11** – Dev-override path rules.
- **TD9** – Standardize 422 error envelope.

### C. Pagination & Filtering

- **TD15** – Add `hasMore` boolean to list responses.
- **TD14** – Switch to composite/opaque cursors post-DB migration.

### D. API Consistency & Mappers

- **TD16** – ✅ Resolved.
- **TD17** – ✅ Resolved.
